# basicvalidationform
This form includes fields for name, email, phone number, password, age, gender, date, and a color picker.
The JavaScript code performs basic validation on the form inputs, displaying error messages if any fields are not filled in correctly. 
If all the fields pass validation, the form can be submitted.
